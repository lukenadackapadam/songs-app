# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# songs = Song.create(title: "Numb", album: "Meteora", artist: "Linkin Park", year: "2003")

# songs = Song.create(title: "Beat It", album: "Thriller", artist: "Michael Jackson", year: "1982")
